				Welcome to the Koala Bear National Information Center! In this
				site you can learn about Koala bears, adopt a Koala, give to our
				foundation, sign up for our newsletter, or schedule a
				visit.Please take some time to explore the information provided
				in this site!

				The Koala Bear National Information Center (KBNIC) is the
				principal non-profit, non-government organization dedicated to
				the conservation and effective management of the wild koala and
				its habitat.
			</p>
			<p>
				The KBNIC was formed in 2006. Since our founding the KBNIC has
				grown from a small group of people interested in researching
				koala disease, to a well-known, global organization with a
				strong track record in strategic koala research, conservation
				and community education with a huge focus on mapping -- our
				absolute strength.
			</p>
			<p>
				Koalas are disappearing. Loss of koala habitat and koala food
				trees (eucalyptus leaves) is the leading koala threat. Our
				cuddly koalas are loved around the world. Often called a koala
				bear, they are actually marsupials not koala bears. Please help
				koalas by supporting the Australian Koala Foundation.
