		<h2>What is Wind Energy?</h2>

		<p>
			Wind power or wind energy is mostly the use of wind turbines to
			generate electricity. Wind power is a popular, sustainable,
			renewable energy source that has a much smaller impact on the
			environment than burning fossil fuels. Historically, wind power has
			been used in sails, windmills and windpumps but today it is mostly
			used to generate electricity. Wind farms consist of many individual
			wind turbines, which are connected to the electric power
			transmission network.<cite

			>
		</p>
		<p>
			There are many advantages and disadvantages of using wind energy to
			create electricity.
		</p>

		<p>Here are some <strong>Advantages</strong> wind turbines.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Creates jobs</li>
			<li>Clean fuel source</li>
			<li>It's sistainable</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			All though there are alot of advantages of wind turbines there are
			many <em>Disadvantages</em>
			too.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Possiable noise pollution</li>
			<li>Wind can impact local wildlife</li>
			<li>
				Location of wind farm may be far from citys where electricity is
				needed
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			In 2021, wind supplied over <strong><em>1800 TWh</em></strong> of
			electricity, which was over 6% of world electricity and about 2% of
			world energy. With about 100 GW added during 2021, mostly in China
			and the United States, global installed wind power capacity exceeded
			800 GW. To help meet the Paris Agreement goals to limit climate
			change, analysts say it should expand much faster - by over 1% of
			electricity generation per year.<cite
