					<h2>How do Koala's behave?</h2>

                        <h2>How do Koala's Populate?</h2>
                        <p>Koalas breed once a year. Gestation lasts 35 days, after which one koala is born. The baby koala is very small when it is born, and lives in its mother's pouch for five to seven months. After this time, koalas gradually become independent and survive on their own.
